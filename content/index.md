Hello! My name is James and I love creating things that live on the internet.

My passion for web development started back in 2008 when I was creating UIs for games at university. Little did I know that those hours spent hacking together game menus would teach me so much about HTML and CSS.

Since then, I've had the privilege of working for one of the biggest companies in the world, a student accommodation provider, several advertising agencies, and a start-up.

Today, my focus is on mastering full stack frameworks to build accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences that delight users and make a real impact.
